# Snake Game in C++

Welcome to the Snake Game! This C++ console-based game allows you to control a snake and collect fruits to score points. The game features multiple modes, including an Easy mode with no death on touching the walls and a Medium mode where touching the walls results in game over. You can also view the Hall of Fame to see the high scores of previous players. The game includes a save feature to store your score for future reference.

## How to Play

2. Compile and run the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your game mode and control the snake:
